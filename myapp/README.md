This is proven through our use of encryption, validation and authentication!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Brainstorm
In order to ensure that petCare exudes a distinct brand identity, I initially brainstormed ideas of what type of company my website would be for, and what they stood for.

<!-- ![image6][image6] -->

### MoodBoards
I then created mood boards with numerous concepts, colour schemes and styles. This helped me visualise how I wanted to present the petCare brand and my website as a whole.


### Wireframes
Once I had decided on an idea, I then began wireframing. This allowed for smoother front end development.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

React, a javascript library was utilized in the creation of my project. Allowing the establishment of our website, through object-orientated programming.
We further developed PetCare and its functionality through the introduction of PHP. This allowed us to extract, replace and add, relevant data to our databases. Which were accessed through the use of MAMP.


### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Created application using react
Here I set up my files and created the components which I would use in my website. I also implemented the basic frontend.


* Created my database
I then created my database, which would hold all the vital information for petCare.

* Began implementation of php
I slowly began making use of php, in order to create communication between my code and the database.

* Implemented Functionality
Through the use of react,php and sql, I was able to implement the required functionality.


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
Being able to create a website with as much functionality as petcare was was very fulfilling and challenged me as a developer but my skills have definitely grown. Along with my excitement towards real-world projects. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
For this assignment, I struggled with adapting to the introduction of PHP and how to render information extracted using PHP.  However, through numerous trials and errors, I was able to overcome this.

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* I implemented react calendar
* I made use of moment.js
* I enhanced the application by adding a to-do list
* I made use of git-helmet and dynamically loaded a favicon in order to enhance navigation.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In future I would like to add additional functionality - push above and beyond the brief
* I would like to add additional pages to enhance my website and its contents,such as a trainer card page.
