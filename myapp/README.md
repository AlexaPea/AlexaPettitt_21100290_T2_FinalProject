<!--PROJECT DESCRIPTION-->
## About the Project
<!-- header image of project -->
![image1](pokemonproject/src/Images/Ideation/intro.png)

### Project Description

PetCare helps improve the day-to-day working lives of receptionists by providing an application which helps them perform their daily tasks! This allows the receptionists to stay and track and work quickly and efficiently. We value our users and their time, and therefore, we aim to create a struggle free process. This is proven through our use of encryption, validation and authentication!

### Built With

* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [react-calendar](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-calendar)
* [MAMP](/http://localhost/MAMP/)
* [php](https://www.php.net/)

### All The PokeApi Data Your Heart Desires! 
Using the PokeApi, we have collected and communicated all relevant Pokemon data into once seemless react experience!


### View General Stats!
The home page provides our fellow trainers with API generated content! Here they are able to view the basic knowledge needed to begin their journey!


### Compare Any Two Pokemon!
Poke-Pal allows you to select any two Pokemon of your choosing to compare! Here you are able to see each Pokemons statistics, catch rate, and who would win in battle!


### View Growth Rates!
The Timeline page provides users the opportunity to view the different Pokemon growth rates through graphs. As you toggle between different rate, relevent information will be provided!





<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.

### Ideation
In order to begin my website ideation process, I first needed to choose an API. I chose to make use of PokeApi.

### Wireframes
Once I had a clear concept for the website I wanted to achieve, I began creating wireframes.


### Custom UI
I then gained UI and branding inspiration using Pinterest, Behance and Dribble. I found myself gravitating to clean, simplistic yet playful designs which I felt would compliment my API data and create a memorable branding for the website.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

I began the Development process by choosing an API, and ultimately decided on the PokeAPI. This API data would dynamically populate my websites content. Once I completed my ideation for my website. I continued to the website creation.

React, a javascript library, was utilized in the creation of my project. Allowing the creation of the numerous components required in my project. This allowed for the practice of object-orientated programming.

I then installed the necesarry libraries and plugins required for the website, this included Charts.js which would be utilized to visually communiate my API data, through dynamically populated charts.


### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: https://pokeapi.co/ 


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Through this project I gained more skills which have aided me in my growth as a developer. 
* I learnt new libraries, such as react and charts.js, which have encouraged me to push myself to learn even more libraries and plugins that could enhance my capabilities as a full stack developer.
* I also found that creating a website based on content I am interested in has made me feel more motivated and encouraged to pursue development further.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* I struggled with adjusting to React and the numerous hooks.
* I found that I faced many challenges with the assynchronous API calls, often struggling with retrieving the data successfully.
* Using props across components was a challenge in certain cirumstances as props would read as undefined.

* However, through numerous trials and errors, i was able to overcome these issues.


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* I learnt how to change the button colours when active through the use of functions and function calls I had previously been unaware of.
* I further studied the Chart.js documentation in order to style my graphs more proffessionaly.
* I learnt how to created onClick functions in react.
* I did further research on react-router-dom in  order to implement more components from that library i.e NavLinks


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* In future I would like to add more graphs and contextualise these graphs to a greater degree.
* I would like to add additional pages to enhance my website and its contents,such as a trainer card page.
* I would like to add more content to the "winner" block on my comparisons page.
